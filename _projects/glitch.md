Glitch was a quick projection installation made for an event at _Verkstad Konsthall_ in Norrk√∂ping.
The event was _Bring your own beamer_, all you had to do was to bring your beamer and a projection.
We used a webcam as video input and mapped it into a sphere.
The spehere was then displaced using the frequency and amplitude from the microphone.

This was made using _Three.js_ and built with webpack.
Everything is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielronnkvist/glitch).
