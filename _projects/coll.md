Coll was developed during East Sweden Hack 2014 in Link√∂ping.
It's an application that tracks your movement and categorizes different stretches with the help of the phones GPS.
It the visualizes your carbon dioxide compared against goals that you setup yourself.
The app then gives suggestions on how to lower your carbon dioxide emission by for example showing public transport routes.

During the hackaton a mockup suited for the iPhone was developed. It is live [here](http://danielronnkvist.github.io/Coll/) and the source code for the project can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielronnkvist/Coll).

Coll won Spotify's prize for best student project.
